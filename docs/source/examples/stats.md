## fMRI statistical analysis

The fMRI data were analysed with CPP SPM (v1.1.5dev;
https://github.com/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_SPM; DOI:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3554331) using statistical parametric mapping
(SPM12 - 7771; Wellcome Center for Neuroimaging, London, UK;
https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm; RRID:SCR_007037) using MATLAB 9.2.0.538062
(R2017a) on a unix computer (Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS).

The input data were the preprocessed BOLD images in IXI549Space space for the
task " facerepetition ".

### Run / subject level analysis

At the subject level, we performed a mass univariate analysis with a linear
regression at each voxel of the brain, using generalized least squares with a
global AR(1) model to account for temporal auto-correlation and a drift fit with
discrete cosine transform basis ( 128 seconds cut-off).

Image intensity scaling was done run-wide before statistical modeling such that
the mean image would have a mean intracerebral intensity of 100.

We modeled the fMRI experiment in a event design with regressors entered into
the run-specific design matrix. The onsets were convolved with SPM canonical
hemodynamic response function (HRF) and its temporal and dispersion derivatives
for the conditions:

-   `famous_1`,
-   `famous_2`,
-   `unfamiliar_1`,
-   `unfamiliar_2`, .

Nuisance covariates included:

-   `trans_?`,
-   `rot_?`,

to account for residual motion artefacts, .
